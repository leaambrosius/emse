# Empirical Methods in Software Engineering: Sports Apps and Sports Motivation

## Overview

This is the "Empirical Methods of Software Engineering" project! We analyzed an empirical survey to investigate the correlation between sports app usage and sports motivation. Our central research question was: "Is the usage of sports apps correlated to sports motivation?"
